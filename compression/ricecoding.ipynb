    "**Note**: as we have seen in the previous video, the remainder can be 'simplified' by removing the leading zeros. So r = 0011 = 11, and 20 can be encoded as 1010. This approach is correct if we encode a single number but, as we will see, it is not an useful approach if we want to enconde a block of data (several numbers)."
